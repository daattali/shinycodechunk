Description: Display a series of code chunks with syntax highlighting. Each
    chunk can optionally have Insert/Modify/Delete buttons. Usually a code
    chunk is a single line of code, but a code chunk can be multiple lines
    if you want to allow interactions (add/modify/delete a code chunk) that 
    should operate on multiple lines together. One chunk can be shown as 
    containing an error/bug.
